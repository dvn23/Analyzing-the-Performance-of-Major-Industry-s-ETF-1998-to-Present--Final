# Analyzing-the-Performance-of-Major-Industries-ETF-1998-to-Present
## Overview
A study of how six major sector ETFs—Technology, Energy, Financials, Industrials, Healthcare, and Real Estate—have performed through major macroeconomic cycles.
## Key Questions: 
1. Which industry outperforms during periods of economic downturn (e.g., 2008 financial crisis, COVID-19 crash, recent inflation surge)?
2. Which industries are the most resilient during economic shocks? Which ones experience the worst drawdowns?
3. How do rising interest rates impact different industries? Do some industries  thrive while others decline?
4. How does inflation affect different industries? Are certain industries inflation-proof?

##Insight and Recomendations
Based on the analysis of six major industry ETFs from 1998 to present, including their drawdowns, volatility, and performance across four major economic downturns, here’s a strategic portfolio recommendation for long-term investors seeking a balance of resilience, growth, and risk-adjusted performance:
1. Healthcare: Consistently shows the lowest drawdowns, lowest volatility, and fastest recovery during market crashes (Dot-Com, 2008, COVID-19). Reccomended Allocation: 35%
2. Real Estate: Despite being sensitive to interest rates, Real Estate has demonstrated some of the fastest and strongest post-crisis rebounds (2008, COVID-19) and has outpaced the S&P 500 in long-term growth. Reccomended Allocation: 25%
3. Industrials: Offers steady growth and relatively stable volatility. While it has more drawdown outliers than Healthcare, it recovered faster than Financials and Energy post-2008. Reccomended Allocation: 20%
4. Technology: Most volatile industry, hit hardest in downturns, but also delivers the strongest returns during bull markets. Recovered quickly after COVID and led post-2020 rallies. Reccomended Allocation: 15%
